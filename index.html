            <h2 id="nospace">At Wilmington University</h2>
        
        </header>

            <p>The total amount of federal student aid for which you qualify at Wilmington University for the entire
                academic year is determined by your Budget or “Cost of Attendance”. Therefore, changes in your
                enrollment will directly impact your financial aid.</p>

            <p>Your initial “Cost of Attendance” (COA) assigned for the year is based on the anticipated attendance you
                told us when you completed the WU App for Financial Aid online. However, your COA must be recalculated
                if you do not attend for a full 4 months in each semester – thus your total aid <b>MAY BE REDUCED</b> to prevent
                or fix an over-award. An over-award occurs when your total aid exceeds your COA for the year. </p>

            <p><b>*Dependent Student = Undergraduate students whose parents were required to sign the FAFSA</b></p>
